Cinder block for Newtek's NDI video-over-IP protocol. See it in action here .

You will need to download the NDI SDK seperately as currently the license does not permit shipping it with 3rd party software.

Before building the samples you will need to export the NDI_SDK_PATH env variable to the directory where you unzipped the NDI SDK.

Currently only CMake project files for OS X and Linux are provided so you will need the current android_linux branch from Cinder's official repo to build the samples. For best results build the release version of Cinder once you have checked out the android_linux branch.

Once you have Cinder setup clone the block into the blocks folder and cd Cinder/blocks/Cinder-NDI/samples/sampleDir/proj/cmake && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && make -j4

Do not forget to export NDI_SDK_PATH=/path/to/NDI/folder before attempting to build a sample.
